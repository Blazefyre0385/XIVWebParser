# FFXIV Web Parser

A simple PHP web project that allows someone in your party or raid group to view their DPS numbers.

## Short Description

If you've ever had raid members or friends that play on PS4 ask about their DPS parsing numbers, then you maybe understand my reasoning behind creating this! I am by no means a high level developer, so this is definitely a work in progress.

## Prerequisites

In order for this setup to work you will need the following items installed and setup first:

* [Advanced Combat Tracker](https://advancedcombattracker.com/download.php) - with the FFXIV Plugin enabled
* Microsoft SQL Server or [MySQL database](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
* A computer with Internet Information Services (IIS) setup and running.

## Installation Guide

I will start working on this section very soon!
